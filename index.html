    <h2>Day of the Dead</h2>
    <p>
      I arrive in Guatemala on The Day of the Dead, November 1st. I’m curious
      about this holiday, so I go to the cemetery to see what’s happening. What
      I find is quite interesting. The atmosphere is like a party. There are
      people everywhere. Families are sitting around the graves of their dead
      ancestors. They clean the graves and add fresh flowers. I walk through the
      cemetery and admire the beauty of all the colorful flowers. There is also
      color in the sky, because many kids are flying kites. Some families are
      having a picnic next to the graves. They eat, drink, and chat together.
      People laugh and smile. In the Unites States, cemeteries are always
      somber. We certainly never have festivals or parties next to graves. We
      don’t laugh or play music or fly kites in cemeteries either. I find that I
      prefer the Guatemalan approach. I like the way they remember and celebrate
      those who have passed away. I like that they acknowledge death, instead of
      denying it the way Americans do. I like that there is life, as well as
      death, in their cemeteries. Guatemalans call it “The Day of the Dead”, but
      it is also a day to appreciate life.

    <h2>Bubba’s Food</h2>
    <p>
      Sara Smith, who lives in San Francisco, went shopping for cat food. Sara
      is 30, and lives at 3037 Market St. She has lived there since 1990. Sara
      is married. She is married to a man named John. She has been married for 7
      years. They have two children, and one very big cat. Their son Bob is five
      years old and their daughter Nancy is three. Their cat, Bubba, is 2 years
      old. Bubba is huge. He weighs 258 pounds (117 kilos)! At 9am, Sara got
      into her car and drove to the pet store. She bought 68 bags of cat food
      for $10 each plus tax. The regular price was $15, so she got a good deal.
      The total was $680. She paid by credit card. On her way home, Sara stopped
      at a convenience store to buy milk. Bubba loves milk. The milk was $3.00
      for one gallon, and Sara bought 30 gallons. She paid $100 and got $10 back
      in change. Sara got home at 11 a.m. Bubba was waiting at the door. He was
      very hungry.

    <h2>Changed</h2>
    <p>
      My husband of 39 years no longer hugs me or shows me any affection. I have
      seen him through cancer and diabetes. We have four grown children, and we
      have been seeing a therapist for a year and a half. He is kind, generous
      and friendly, but there are no compliments or any of the flirtatious
      banter we used to enjoy. He swears he's not having an affair, and he
      doesn't know why he has changed. Perhaps you do?

      HIGH PRICE OF MOM'S HELP IS DRAG ON FAMILY BUSINESS
      <br />
      DEAR ABBY: Twenty years ago, my sister and I bought a business from our
      mother. <br />
      We all love and respect one another and get along well. <br />
      We will be finished paying off the business in two years. <br />
      Our problem: Mom, who is now 77, still draws a salary from us above and
      beyond the payment for the business. Her workload has lessened greatly, as
      it should. <br />
      She could do all of her work in one day and lessen the burden of her
      salary. <br />
      However, she says she'd "go crazy" if she retired. We don't want that.
      <br />
      She could still come in as often as she wants and do her personal
      paperwork, bank- ing, letter-writing, reading, etc. <br />
      These are all things she does at "work" -- on the clock. If we try to
      discuss this, Mom gets hurt and says, "Just let me know when I'm not worth
      the money." <br />
      We don't want to do that. We would hope she would see the fairness of this
      and suggest it herself. Business expenses are going through the roof, and
      there are updates we should make, but we can't do it as long as we are
      paying Mom at the level we are, on top of the money for the buy-out.

    <h2>Intimacy</h2>
    <p>
      DEAR ABBY:
      <br />
      My husband, "James," and I have been married only three years. We are both
      in our 20s. Everything is really great between us -- except our sex life.
      As far as he is concerned that's fine, too, but I am not satisfied. It may
      seem odd to hear the female wants to have sex more frequently than a young
      and healthy male, but that's the case in our relationship. Abby, I work
      with the public and I get frequent remarks about what a beautiful woman I
      am. This makes it hard for me to believe that I don't attract him at all.
      I have expressed many times that I wish we were more intimate. I have even
      expressed it to him in more than one letter, hoping to reach him. I am at
      a total loss as to how to make him realize how important this is to me. Is
      there something wrong with my body? I just don't know who to turn to for
      advice on this subject. Please help me. <br />

      Secret Love WOMAN HESITATES TO REVEAL SECRET LOVE FOR COLLEAGUE DEAR ABBY:
      I am a single woman in my early 30s who has never been married. I recently
      fell in love with a won- derful man with whom I spend a great deal of
      time. He is unaware of the intensity of my feelings, and I'm afraid of
      telling him out of fear of rejection. There are a couple of additional
      concerns: He is 15 years my senior and a medical doctor. I am a social
      worker in a lower economic class. In addition, we are of different
      religions, but we have simi- lar spiritual beliefs and values. He is also
      my co-worker. I am very interested in pursuing a deeper relationship with
      this man, but would like to hear your advice first. Thank you for your
      thoughts on this. <br />

    <h2>Bad Choices</h2>
    <h3>
      Publish Date: April 6, 2007 <br />
      Dear Dr. Tracy,
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a 33 year old divorced woman with four kids. I was married for 12
      years and I have been divorced for approximately 3 years. I met my new
      boyfriend during my divorce. We hit it off and have been together ever
      since. He is a 44 year old divorced man. When I met him he had been
      divorced for 2 years. Well, I met his ex- wife and she seemed to be an
      okay person. What I found out 3 months into my relationship with him was
      that he was fooling around with his ex-wife again-- who also at this time
      had a boyfriend of her own. I figured that since I did not have a
      committed relationship with him, I had no place to say anything. The
      problem is it continued further into our relationship, up to the point
      when I found out I was pregnant. At the same time I found out that he and
      his ex-wife planned to go to his family reunion together. Of course before
      all of this, I drove by his house one night and saw her car parked outside
      his home. The excuse I got after all of this was that they were
      considering getting back together. I thought it was very funny that as
      soon as she met me, she found interest in him again. I guess my issue is
      the fact that now I am still in this relationship. I have brought a child
      into this nonsense and I hate the fact that he keeps in contact with her.
      My boyfriend has taken responsibility for her son from a previous
      relationship. His excuse for having so much contact with his ex-wife is
      because of that boy. I know this is not true but I have no real proof
      otherwise. I have also dealt with him taking women to hotels and my gut
      tells me it was her, but he promises it was not her. I have tried to get
      over all the cheating. I know that she is very close to his family and I
      also know that his family does not like me because I stand up for myself.
      I guess the bottom line is knowing how much contact his ex-wife has with
      him and the fact that he knows I can’t stand her. Am I in a weird
      relationship with a man that wants to have his cake and eat it too? Or am
      I being paranoid and need to trust him when he says he does not want her.
      I have never had so much animosity towards two people in my life. I do
      love this man, but I feel like I have put myself back in an unhealthy
      relationship with a man that is trying to lie to me. To be totally honest,
      now that I have his child I even hate the fact that he helps her son. She
      never has to ask for anything regarding that boy, but I have to constantly
      remind him when our son needs something. He does it for the other boy
      without thinking, but my son is a second thought even when I have said,
      “Look at your son. He is in dire need”. I was married to a cheating man
      and hooked up with another cheating man. I wonder if it’s just my bad
      choices in men.

    <h2>Double Standard</h2>
    <h3>
      Publish Date: April 8, 2007 FAMILY IS UNEASY WHEN ONE SISTER DATES OTHER'S
      EX-LOVER<br />
      DEAR ABBY:
    </h3>
    <p>
      My sister, "Jane," and I are both in our mid-50s. Jane has had numerous
      affairs over the past several years after her third divorce, and was
      involved in an "intimate relationship" with a terrific man, "Will," that
      lasted about three months. Jane broke up with Will several months after
      she decided he wasn't what she was looking for, and she's presently
      engaged to be married to a very nice man ("Sam") and seems very happy. I
      dated Will several times before he and Jane became involved. We weren't
      intimate at that time, and we start- ed seeing each other again over the
      last month. This time we have fallen in love. My problem is Jane is upset
      that Will and I are together and says I have "betrayed" her. She is
      worried about having her former and current lovers present at family
      gatherings, and our parents are also concerned. They say it's "just
      weird." The fact that my sister was intimate with Will doesn't bother me
      or Will, but it sure bothers them. Abby, I have always been the "good
      girl" in the family and bowed to their pressure, but my relationship with
      Will is more than I could have ever imagined, and I don't want to give up
      my future happiness just to make my sister and my parents more
      comfortable. My adult children have all met and approve of Will and our
      relation- ship, but Jane and my parents won't budge. Any suggestions? --
      WANTS WILL IN WALLA WALLA, WASH. DEAR WANTS WILL: Perhaps it's time to
      stop being the "good girl," begin acting like a woman who knows what she
      wants, and confront the double standard in your family. If your sister was
      "sophisticated" enough to have serial affairs, and your parents have been
      so worldly they have turned a blind eye to it, then they should all be
      adult enough to realize that you are entitled to your happiness, too.
      Although this may make for some awkward first few family gatherings, as
      grown-ups, everyone should be able to get past it. But if they can't, you
      are going to have to decide whether you want this man, or to be a people-
      pleaser for the rest of your life.
