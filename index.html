      Effortless English Club. Welcome to our new set of lessons, these are
      called the Power English Lessons. The reason they’re called Power English
      is because in these lessons we’re going to do two things. Number one,
      you’re going to learn English, of course. As always, we have the
      mini‑stories which are our favorite lessons for most of our members, but
      the content, the focus, the topics in these lessons are going to be
      focused on the psychology of learning and the psychology of success. Now
      these ideas, they’re not just my ideas. In fact, they come from a lot of
      other people. They come from people like Tony Robbins, who is a famous
      success coach, Robert Anton Wilson, Joe Vitale, Robert Kiyosaki, Alan
      Watt, so I’ve taken a lot of ideas from a lot of different people about
      this topic of the psychology of success. And the reason that we’re going
      to talk about this in these lessons is that in my experience, most English
      students struggle and fail because of psychology, not because of methods,
      not because of teachers. Those things are important, but Tony Robbins
      talks about the fact that psychology is 80% of success. And I think he’s
      right, based on my experience with many, many English students. Psychology
      is 80% of success, so 20% are the methods you use to study. 20% are the
      schools you go to, the teachers you have, the books you use. Those are
      important, we talk a lot about them. But the other 80% is psychology, your
      motivation, your emotions, how you manage your time. All of these things
      are in fact much, much more important. What I saw in my classes were that
      the enthusiastic students, the energetic students, the optimistic students
      always learned much faster. They succeeded. The ones who failed, the ones
      who dropped out and quit, the ones who struggled had the opposite
      mentality. They had a very negative mentality. Their motivation was low.
      They tended to be pessimistic. They felt that they weren’t good at
      English. They had ideas that English was very tough, very difficult, they
      struggled. They didn’t have enthusiasm for English. They didn’t love
      English. So in these lessons we’re going to talk about how can you manage
      your emotions. How can you develop that strong, powerful, enthusiastic
      attitude towards English, how can you maintain it so that you don’t get
      bored? So that in fact you get stronger and stronger with English and your
      psychology gets stronger and you succeed, you reach your goals. You speak
      fluently, effortlessly. So among teachers, English teachers, language
      teachers, this topic is called Non-Linguistic Factors. Non‑Linguistic
      Factors. So what “Non‑Linguistic Factors” means is things that are not
      related to language learning directly. When we talk about language
      learning research, when we talk about the best methods to use when you
      learn English, those are linguistic factors, right? They are related to
      the language. Non‑linguistic factors means not related to the language.
      This has nothing to do with English, it’s more about psychology.
      Motivation, for example, is a non‑linguistic factor. So all it really
      means is just emotional factors. And there are actually many research
      studies about this topic. Dr. Stephen Krashen down in Los Angeles,
      probably again the expert in language acquisition and language learning,
      has done many studies and he has also looked at many studies and he’s
      found that non‑linguistic factors are equally or in fact more important
      than the linguistic factors to determine who is successful ultimately.
      What that means is that things like your emotions, things like your peer
      group, the community that you belong to, your feelings about English are
      as important or more important than the methods you’re using to learn
      English. So how are we going to do this? How are we going to learn? Well,
      one of the things we have to do is create a daily English ritual. You need
      to engage your physiology. That means you need to engage and use your
      body. You need to engage and use your subconscious. That’s how you start
      to affect and strengthen your psychology. So we have to strengthen our
      psychology, what does that mean? Really it means affecting your body and
      your mind at the same time, so that you actually feel better. Your
      emotions are happier while you’re learning English. And I know this is the
      opposite of what you learned in school. You probably didn’t feel very
      happy when you were sitting in your English classes. But when you’re
      learning with Effortless English, it’s very important for you to feel
      happy. For your body to feel good, for your mind to feel good. For you to
      emotionally enjoy the process of learning English. Of course, it’s just
      more fun, you’re going to like it a lot better. But the other benefit is
      that you actually will learn faster. You’ll improve your grammar faster,
      you’ll improve your pronunciation faster. You’ll remember vocabulary words
      better, longer and faster when you feel good. So there’s a very practical
      reason for doing this, too. So we’re going to talk a lot in detail in
      these lessons about how to do this. But just right now, during this
      introduction, let’s talk a little bit about a daily plan. Something you
      could do immediately, right now, today, to start improving your success
      with English by changing your psychology. So here’s a little ritual, a
      little plan you can follow every day to start improving, to start feeling
      better and therefore improve your motivation and to learn English faster
      and faster and faster, better and better and better. And it’s very simple.
      So the first thing you’re going to do is when you get up in the morning,
      the first part of this plan, this daily plan. You want to get into a peak
      emotional state. Peak means top. For example, the top of a mountain, when
      we talk about a top of a mountain, the very top we call the peak. So we’re
      saying a peak emotional state means a top emotional state or top emotional
      feeling. It means you want to feel great. Not just good, you want to feel
      really great. That’s the first thing you need to do before you listen to
      any English lessons. Before you study you want to first be sure that you
      feel great. How can you do it? Well, it’s really easy. I recommend, for
      example, using music. And I actually do this myself in the morning, most
      mornings. I will put on some great, exciting music that I love, jump
      around, act like a crazy person, and get myself feeling energetic and
      happy. Do that first before you listen. So move your body, smile. We’re
      going to talk about this more in detail in later lessons. But just for
      now, every morning when you get up first put on some music. Some
      energetic, happy music that you like, smile, move around. Do that for
      maybe 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes. Then when you’re feeling really great,
      your body is moving, you feel like you have energy, you’re happy, then
      start your English lessons. The first thing you want to listen to is the
      main article, the main audio. So the first thing is listen to the main
      talk. And you can read this as well the first time if you cannot
      understand easily, you can read the transcript and listen at the same
      time. Do this perhaps two times per day, starting with the main story and
      reading. Use a dictionary if you need to to look up new words. Next,
      listen to the vocabulary. So in the vocabulary again I will discuss the
      meanings of some of the difficult words that I used. And again, you can
      read the transcript of that vocabulary lesson. There’s always a transcript
      you can read if you can’t understand my speaking, if I’m too fast, then
      read at the same time. It’s okay. Next, you’ll listen to the mini‑story
      and the mini‑story is the most important lesson. The mini‑story is
      designed for deep learning. In the mini‑story I am going to ask a lot of
      very easy questions while I tell a story. In fact I really ask the story,
      I don’t tell the story. Why am I doing this? Students ask me “Why are the
      questions so easy?” Well, the questions are supposed to be easy because I
      want you to answer fast and automatically. I want you to train your brain,
      teach your brain to answer very quickly. I don’t want you to translate
      from your language to English or from English to your language. It’s a bad
      habit, it will make you speak very slowly. I want you to just answer
      quickly, automatically, very fast. So that’s why I ask so many questions,
      like questions again, again, again, again, again…very easy. Your
      job…answer the questions quickly. You can answer with only one or two
      words, its okay. Short answers are fine. You don’t need to answer with a
      big, long sentence. In fact, short is better. So that’s the order that
      you’re going to follow. You’re going to listen to the main article first,
      one or two times. You can read as well if you need to. Then you’re going
      to listen to the vocabulary one or two times, each day. And then finally
      you’re going to listen to the mini‑story, one or two times or more. You
      can also read the transcript for the mini‑story in the beginning. Now
      another important point, when you’re listening to these lessons do not
      study them. Don’t struggle to memorize. Just relax and listen. If
      necessary, you can read as well, as I said if you need to. But relax,
      you’re not trying to memorize anything. Just let it come in. Let the
      English come into your ears and into your eyes. Don’t think about it.
      Don’t analyze it. Do not think about grammar. The mini‑stories will help
      you learn grammar subconsciously, so don’t interrupt that process by
      trying to analyze it. Don’t think about grammar rules. You want to learn
      like a native speaker and that means you’re going to learn the patterns of
      English in these mini‑stories. You might not be able to explain them, just
      like native speakers cannot explain grammar rules. But that’s okay, you
      want to be able to use them correctly. That’s the important part. So
      again, you want to relax. Do not study. Do not think about grammar rules.
      Do not try to translate. Just relax and listen. That’s why we call it
      Effortless English. It should be effortless. You should be smiling,
      relaxed and just listening. Now another important point. You want to move
      your body while you’re listening to the lessons. This will keep your
      energy high. So, what do I mean by that? Well, a really easy way to do
      this is just to walk. You’ve got an iPod, you’ve got your earphones in,
      listen to the lessons while you go for a walk. You can do two things at
      one time. You exercise, you improve your body and you listen to English
      lessons and improve your mind at the same time. If you’re sitting in a
      train, then maybe you just stretch your body a little bit. If you’re in
      your car, you can move a little bit. You can move around in your seat. If
      you’re at your house you can go crazy, you can jump around. You can
      exercise very strongly. You can go to the gym. Do something with your body
      while you’re listening to the lessons. It will keep your energy high. It
      will keep you feeling better. You will actually learn faster by doing
      that. And finally, a very, very important point. You need to use our deep
      learning method. That means you listen to each lesson set for one week or
      more. So for example, this introduction has got three parts. There is a
      main lecture, a main talk. There is a vocabulary section. And there is a
      mini‑story. Well those three, you want to listen to those three every day
      for seven days. You want that repetition. Repetition is very important.
      You want it to go deeply into your brain. Just one time is not enough.
      Even if it is very easy for you, if you listen you understand everything,
      it’s simple, still follow the deep learning method. Still listen to the
      whole set for one week or more. On the other hand, if it seems very
      difficult, listen longer. Two weeks is okay. Doesn’t matter, the point is
      you want it to go very deeply into your brain which means you want it to
      be almost effortless. It’s going to just go into your brain and eventually
      just come out without you thinking and that requires deep learning. It
      requires a lot of repetition. So that’s kind of your basic plan for using
      these lessons. Again, first you’re going to get into a peak state. You’re
      going to get excited. You’re going to jump around. You’re going to listen
      to music. You’re going to feel great. Then you’re going to listen to the
      main lecture, the main audio, one or two times. Then you’re going to
      listen to the vocabulary, one or two times. Then you’re going to listen to
      the mini‑story, one, two, three, four, five times…every day. And remember,
      relax, feel good and enjoy the lessons while you listen. Okay, that is it
      for our main section for this introduction. Next is the vocabulary.

    <h2>Day of the Dead</h2>
    <p>
      I arrive in Guatemala on The Day of the Dead, November 1st. I’m curious
      about this holiday, so I go to the cemetery to see what’s happening. What
      I find is quite interesting. The atmosphere is like a party. There are
      people everywhere. Families are sitting around the graves of their dead
      ancestors. They clean the graves and add fresh flowers. I walk through the
      cemetery and admire the beauty of all the colorful flowers. There is also
      color in the sky, because many kids are flying kites. Some families are
      having a picnic next to the graves. They eat, drink, and chat together.
      People laugh and smile. In the Unites States, cemeteries are always
      somber. We certainly never have festivals or parties next to graves. We
      don’t laugh or play music or fly kites in cemeteries either. I find that I
      prefer the Guatemalan approach. I like the way they remember and celebrate
      those who have passed away. I like that they acknowledge death, instead of
      denying it the way Americans do. I like that there is life, as well as
      death, in their cemeteries. Guatemalans call it “The Day of the Dead”, but
      it is also a day to appreciate life.

    <h2>Bubba’s Food</h2>
    <p>
      Sara Smith, who lives in San Francisco, went shopping for cat food. Sara
      is 30, and lives at 3037 Market St. She has lived there since 1990. Sara
      is married. She is married to a man named John. She has been married for 7
      years. They have two children, and one very big cat. Their son Bob is five
      years old and their daughter Nancy is three. Their cat, Bubba, is 2 years
      old. Bubba is huge. He weighs 258 pounds (117 kilos)! At 9am, Sara got
      into her car and drove to the pet store. She bought 68 bags of cat food
      for $10 each plus tax. The regular price was $15, so she got a good deal.
      The total was $680. She paid by credit card. On her way home, Sara stopped
      at a convenience store to buy milk. Bubba loves milk. The milk was $3.00
      for one gallon, and Sara bought 30 gallons. She paid $100 and got $10 back
      in change. Sara got home at 11 a.m. Bubba was waiting at the door. He was
      very hungry.

    <p>
      My husband of 39 years no longer hugs me or shows me any affection. I have
      seen him through cancer and diabetes. We have four grown children, and we
      have been seeing a therapist for a year and a half. He is kind, generous
      and friendly, but there are no compliments or any of the flirtatious
      banter we used to enjoy. He swears he's not having an affair, and he
      doesn't know why he has changed. Perhaps you do?

      HIGH PRICE OF MOM'S HELP IS DRAG ON FAMILY BUSINESS
      <br />
      DEAR ABBY: <br />
      Twenty years ago, my sister and I bought a business from our mother.
      <br />
      We all love and respect one another and get along well. <br />
      We will be finished paying off the business in two years. <br />
      Our problem: Mom, who is now 77, still draws a salary from us above and
      beyond the payment for the business. Her workload has lessened greatly, as
      it should. <br />
      She could do all of her work in one day and lessen the burden of her
      salary. <br />
      However, she says she'd "go crazy" if she retired. We don't want that.
      <br />
      She could still come in as often as she wants and do her personal
      paperwork, bank- ing, letter-writing, reading, etc. <br />
      These are all things she does at "work" -- on the clock. If we try to
      discuss this, Mom gets hurt and says, "Just let me know when I'm not worth
      the money." <br />
      We don't want to do that. We would hope she would see the fairness of this
      and suggest it herself. Business expenses are going through the roof, and
      there are updates we should make, but we can't do it as long as we are
      paying Mom at the level we are, on top of the money for the buy-out.

    <h2>Intimacy</h2>
    <p>
      DEAR ABBY:
      <br />
      My husband, "James," and I have been married only three years. We are both
      in our 20s. Everything is really great between us -- except our sex life.
      As far as he is concerned that's fine, too, but I am not satisfied. It may
      seem odd to hear the female wants to have sex more frequently than a young
      and healthy male, but that's the case in our relationship. Abby, I work
      with the public and I get frequent remarks about what a beautiful woman I
      am. This makes it hard for me to believe that I don't attract him at all.
      I have expressed many times that I wish we were more intimate. I have even
      expressed it to him in more than one letter, hoping to reach him. I am at
      a total loss as to how to make him realize how important this is to me. Is
      there something wrong with my body? I just don't know who to turn to for
      advice on this subject. Please help me. <br />

      Secret Love WOMAN HESITATES TO REVEAL SECRET LOVE FOR COLLEAGUE DEAR ABBY:
      I am a single woman in my early 30s who has never been married. I recently
      fell in love with a won- derful man with whom I spend a great deal of
      time. He is unaware of the intensity of my feelings, and I'm afraid of
      telling him out of fear of rejection. There are a couple of additional
      concerns: He is 15 years my senior and a medical doctor. I am a social
      worker in a lower economic class. In addition, we are of different
      religions, but we have simi- lar spiritual beliefs and values. He is also
      my co-worker. I am very interested in pursuing a deeper relationship with
      this man, but would like to hear your advice first. Thank you for your
      thoughts on this. <br />

    <h3>
      Publish Date: April 6, 2007 <br />
      Dear Dr. Tracy,
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a 33 year old divorced woman with four kids. I was married for 12
      years and I have been divorced for approximately 3 years. I met my new
      boyfriend during my divorce. We hit it off and have been together ever
      since. He is a 44 year old divorced man. When I met him he had been
      divorced for 2 years. Well, I met his ex- wife and she seemed to be an
      okay person. What I found out 3 months into my relationship with him was
      that he was fooling around with his ex-wife again-- who also at this time
      had a boyfriend of her own. I figured that since I did not have a
      committed relationship with him, I had no place to say anything. The
      problem is it continued further into our relationship, up to the point
      when I found out I was pregnant. At the same time I found out that he and
      his ex-wife planned to go to his family reunion together. Of course before
      all of this, I drove by his house one night and saw her car parked outside
      his home. The excuse I got after all of this was that they were
      considering getting back together. I thought it was very funny that as
      soon as she met me, she found interest in him again. I guess my issue is
      the fact that now I am still in this relationship. I have brought a child
      into this nonsense and I hate the fact that he keeps in contact with her.
      My boyfriend has taken responsibility for her son from a previous
      relationship. His excuse for having so much contact with his ex-wife is
      because of that boy. I know this is not true but I have no real proof
      otherwise. I have also dealt with him taking women to hotels and my gut
      tells me it was her, but he promises it was not her. I have tried to get
      over all the cheating. I know that she is very close to his family and I
      also know that his family does not like me because I stand up for myself.
      I guess the bottom line is knowing how much contact his ex-wife has with
      him and the fact that he knows I can’t stand her. Am I in a weird
      relationship with a man that wants to have his cake and eat it too? Or am
      I being paranoid and need to trust him when he says he does not want her.
      I have never had so much animosity towards two people in my life. I do
      love this man, but I feel like I have put myself back in an unhealthy
      relationship with a man that is trying to lie to me. To be totally honest,
      now that I have his child I even hate the fact that he helps her son. She
      never has to ask for anything regarding that boy, but I have to constantly
      remind him when our son needs something. He does it for the other boy
      without thinking, but my son is a second thought even when I have said,
      “Look at your son. He is in dire need”. I was married to a cheating man
      and hooked up with another cheating man. I wonder if it’s just my bad
      choices in men.

      Publish Date: April 8, 2007 FAMILY IS UNEASY WHEN ONE SISTER DATES OTHER'S
      EX-LOVER<br />
      DEAR ABBY:
    </h3>
    <p>
      My sister, "Jane," and I are both in our mid-50s. Jane has had numerous
      affairs over the past several years after her third divorce, and was
      involved in an "intimate relationship" with a terrific man, "Will," that
      lasted about three months. Jane broke up with Will several months after
      she decided he wasn't what she was looking for, and she's presently
      engaged to be married to a very nice man ("Sam") and seems very happy. I
      dated Will several times before he and Jane became involved. We weren't
      intimate at that time, and we start- ed seeing each other again over the
      last month. This time we have fallen in love. My problem is Jane is upset
      that Will and I are together and says I have "betrayed" her. She is
      worried about having her former and current lovers present at family
      gatherings, and our parents are also concerned. They say it's "just
      weird." The fact that my sister was intimate with Will doesn't bother me
      or Will, but it sure bothers them. Abby, I have always been the "good
      girl" in the family and bowed to their pressure, but my relationship with
      Will is more than I could have ever imagined, and I don't want to give up
      my future happiness just to make my sister and my parents more
      comfortable. My adult children have all met and approve of Will and our
      relation- ship, but Jane and my parents won't budge. Any suggestions? --
      WANTS WILL IN WALLA WALLA, WASH. DEAR WANTS WILL: Perhaps it's time to
      stop being the "good girl," begin acting like a woman who knows what she
      wants, and confront the double standard in your family. If your sister was
      "sophisticated" enough to have serial affairs, and your parents have been
      so worldly they have turned a blind eye to it, then they should all be
      adult enough to realize that you are entitled to your happiness, too.
      Although this may make for some awkward first few family gatherings, as
      grown-ups, everyone should be able to get past it. But if they can't, you
      are going to have to decide whether you want this man, or to be a people-
      pleaser for the rest of your life.
